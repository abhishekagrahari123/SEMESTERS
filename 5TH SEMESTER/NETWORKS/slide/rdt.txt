1.0 = assumes no bit errors and packet loss.
2.0 = it has checksum(to detect bit errors)
2.1 = it has seq number(to detect bit errors of reciever message of ack or nak)
retransmission is to be done therefore to remove confusion at receiver end of old
new packet it is introduced.
2.2 = only ack for last correctly recieved
3.0 = packet loss. 

rdt 3.0 = if sender recieves corrupt or wrong seq number ack no action. action taken at 
timeout only.

go back n = it don't give acknowlege of out of order packet, cumulative acknowlegment, timer
for oldest inflight packet.
selective repeat = reciever selectively acknowleges out of order packet, sender maintain
timer for each unacked packed and selectively retransmit unacked packet.

window size <= 1/2*sequence number space.
sample rrt affect decays exponentially.
2way handshake?

congestion control = too many sender too much send data difficult for network to control
flow control = one sender send too much data difficult for reciever to control

multiplexing
congestion control
udp checksum
udp packet
