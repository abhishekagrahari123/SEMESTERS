if process demands we are giving at that time but delaying for page faults
if tf->trapno = T_PGFLT process needs new memory
allocuvm called by the growproc
u have to call allocuvm in your code

Task1 = to implement paging a kernel program have to be written
void create_kernel_process(cont char *name, void (*entryport)())
it create a kernel process and add it to the processes queue

Task2 = swap out mechanism
whenever kernel tries to allocate memory for a process and fails, kernel should put the process into 
sleeping state and request for a freee page must be submitted to the kernel swaooing out process.

swapping out process will sace current state of rpocess which is to be swapped out, it 
will make the present bit to 0 mark the page as swapped out and make it free page.

Task3: swapping in mechanism:
when the kernel detects a page fault, it must check if the cause of this page fault
is in swapping out mechanism
