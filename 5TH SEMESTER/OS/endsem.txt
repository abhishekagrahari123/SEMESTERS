take p = 7 and q = 13, must be large prime numbers.
N = p*q = 7*13 = 91, 
Choose public key co-prime to (p-1)*(q-1), because of this coprime condition, inverse of
public key exist, give it to reciever.
Let PubKey = 5
We get PriKey = 29
PubKey * PriKey mod (p-1)*(q-1) = 1

for message M, let 69
sent_text = M^(PubKey) mod N, 69^5 mod 91 = 62
decryprion process = (sent_text)^(PriKey) mod N. 62^29 mod 91 = 69 hurray
